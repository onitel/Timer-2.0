# Timer-2.0
https://onitel.github.io/Timer-2.0/

A timer where I used JavaScript, no React or other libraries. I invented the way for the time to pass using setTimeout( () => fun()},1000 ) when I was learning about this posibility to make JS functions from synchronous to asynchronous, and I thought that I can maybe do a timer using this, so I tried and it worked.
